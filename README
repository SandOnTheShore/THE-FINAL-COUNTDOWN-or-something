PI/Breadboard setup:

You will need ONE ultrasonic distance sensor, TWO ground wires, FOUR normal wires, THREE resistors and ONE light.

Set up your light towards one of the four courners of the breadboard and connect the necessary wiring according to the ultrasonic distance sensors needs.

You'll also need one resistor, one normal wire and one ground wire for the light.

After you've connected everything to the appropriate places. It's time to do the coding.

Coding:




USES:

Parking sensor, the different stages of the light will signal to you how close you are.

Security cam, the light can turn on or react depending on the situation like how close someone is.
