PI/Breadboard setup:

You will need ONE ultrasonic distance sensor, TWO ground wires, FOUR normal wires, THREE resistors and ONE light.

Set up your light towards one of the four courners of the breadboard and connect the necessary wiring according to the ultrasonic distance sensors needs.

You'll also need one resistor, one normal wire and one ground wire for the light.

After you've connected everything to the appropriate places. It's time to do the coding.

Coding:

Once you've imported DistanceSensor PMWLED and sleep all you need to do is set up your sensor = DistanceSensor (Echo, trigger and max_distance vary based on needs/location on the Pi)

Then you create a simple while loop, stating while True the following things occur.

If distance is greater than 10 centimeters but less than 20 centimeters than the light is on.

If the distance is less than 5 centimeters it begins to pulse

Finally if it's greater than 20 centimeters away than it is off entirely.


USES:

Parking sensor, the different stages of the light will signal to you how close you are.

Security cam, the light can turn on or react depending on the situation like how close someone is.
